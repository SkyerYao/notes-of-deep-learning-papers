#Very Deep Convolutional Networks For Large-scale Image Recognition
##1 Introduction
In this paper, we address another important aspect of ConvNet architecture design – its depth. 

##2 ConvNet Configurations
###2.1 Architecture
In one of the configurations we also utilise 1 × 1 convolution filters, which can be seen as a linear transformation of the input channels (followed by non-linearity). 
 
Local Response  Normalisation(LRN) does not improve the performance on the ILSVRC dataset, but leads to increased memory consumption and computation time. 

###2.3 Discussion
 It is easy to see that a stack of two 3 × 3 conv. layers (without spatial pooling in between) has an effective receptive field of 5 × 5; three such layers have a 7 × 7effective receptive field.
 
 The incorporation of 1 × 1 conv. layers (configuration C, Table 1) is a way to increase the non-linearity of the decision function without affecting the receptive fields of the conv. layers.
